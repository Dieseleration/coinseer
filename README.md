# coinseer

Coinseer is an experimental project using Google Finance stock market data in conjunction with GDAX bitcoin/ether/litecoin 
pricing data to predict future bitcoin and ether prices
It is composed/will be composed of a few files
As of right now (2/26/2017) there are two files that pull price history data from Google Finance and GDAX, respectively.
From there, the current plan is to use this time-aligned data to train a basic tensorflow nerual net to try and guess bitcoin 
prices moving forward.
The tech stack is pretty much all Python thus far.
